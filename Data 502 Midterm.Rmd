# Load the Tidyverse, Import Data & Run Summary
Loading my tidyverse library, importing my data and utilizing a summary to conduct a quick analysis of the available information.

```{r fast}
library(tidyverse)
fast <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitadasmalley/Teaching/main/DATA502/FA2023/Data/fastFood2022.csv")
summary(fast)

```

## Change Units and Assess Values to identify Variables for plotting

Updating units to represent as Millions.  Running some code to confirm which metrics I am using on my X and Y axis.  Also referencing my summary above to confirm some of this information.  Confirming that I want total_units as my X and avg_sales_per_mil as my Y.  Will be mapping size to systemwide_sales.
edit: ended up coming back to the set-up.  Tropical Smoothie Cafe was giving me grief when attempting to use company in my recreation graph.

```{r details}
fast<-fast%>%
mutate(avg_sales_per_mil=avg_sales_per_thousand/1000)

names(fast)
fast[which.max(fast$total_units),]
fast[which.max(fast$avg_sales_per_mil),]
fast[which.max(fast$systemwide_sales),]

mcd=fast %>%
  filter(company=="McDonald's")

unique(fast$company)
fast[36,]
fast=fast%>%
  mutate(company=str_replace(company, "ï¿½", "e"))

head(fast, 50)
  
```
##Construct my recreation graph
This took a lot longer than I had hoped it would and ended up getting stuck several times.  The initial phase of establishing the plots and getting the basic look was quick.  Once I started getting into the details, things slowed dramatically and became a tad tedious and frustrating.  Doing some of the Datacamp modules again, along with the repeating some of the optional exercises to hopefully identify some skill gaps.


```{r graph}

ggplot(fast, aes(total_units, avg_sales_per_mil))+
  geom_point(alpha=.9, color="#3d4e7f",aes(size=systemwide_sales))+

##Comments on the Recreation
I could not figure out how to change the McDonald's bubble and got frustrated and had to concede that adjustment.  The techniques I was trying kept breaking the graph.  Overall I am satisfied with a deeper understanding of leveraging the labels, annotations, themes and formatting.  It isn't perfect, but I think I got pretty close.
edit:  WOOOOOO I GOT IT!!! Wednesday night!!!  Dug back through the examples and was able to layer it on top.  It may not be perfect, but I freaking got it!  Heck, my solve even got me over the hump related to the yellow ring!  Wahoo!

#Creating an Alternative: A critique of the original
In recreating the original graph, I found the over-labeling a cumbersome (of course in re-reading the instructions, I only needed to do 5 (insert=Homer"doh").  I found it was really only necessary due to the type of the plot.  I found the original graphic overbroad.  As a refined American, I obviously felt compelled to focus in on "Burgers" and remove some of the clutter from my plot.


```{r}
fast %>%
  filter(category=="Burger")%>%
  ggplot(aes(total_units, reorder(company, total_units),color=avg_sales_per_mil))+
  geom_point(aes(size=systemwide_sales))+
  scale_size(range=c(1,8), guide="none")+
  scale_color_continuous(low="#C6AA76", high="#BA0C2F", name="Average Sales per Million")+
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,500),breaks=seq(2500,25000, by=2500))+
  ggtitle("American Burger King? McDonald's Still Reigns")+
  labs(x="Total US Stores (bubble size indicates total sales)", caption="Source: The QSR 2023 Top 50")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(
    axis.ticks=element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.key.height=unit(.2, 'cm'),
    axis.title.x.bottom = element_text(vjust=18, hjust=.8)
  )



```


#Conclusion
I really got on a role once I was able to troubleshoot some issues.  The formatting of Tropical Smoothie Cafe slowed me down until I went back through some notes and was able to correct the data.  Ultimately, there is more I wanted to do with my recreation, but I ran out of time.  I took inspiration from the Di Cook video when I thought through how I wanted to re-imagine the information.  This got me thinking about running a function and loop (which we just learned in Dr. Gore's class the other day) to run and create multiple graphs by category.  I focused on burgers so I could seize the opportunity to leverage a punny title.  Also, when it comes to fast food, secretly everyone initially thinks of burgers.  I am pretty happy with it aside from some other non-data ink adjustments that I would have made with more time to play.  I really enjoyed this process after I got past some stages of frustration and feeling stuck.  I think the more I practice with this, the more I will grow to enjoy it.  I feel much more in command of ggplot now than I did when I started this assignment.
